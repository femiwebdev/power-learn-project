# Layout Responsiveness
A small demo project showcasing a responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox. It demonstrates a header, hero block, a main content area with cards and articles, and a sidebar. The stylesheet emphasizes modern responsive patterns, utility variables, and accessible spacing.

## Features
- Responsive header and navigation
- Grid-based main layout with content and sidebar
- Flexible card components that adapt across breakpoints
- Utility variables for colors, spacing, and radii
- Mobile-first adjustments and graceful stack behavior

## Getting Started
Prerequisites: any modern browser.
To view:
1. Open the project root and open the HTML file (e.g., index.html) in a browser.
2. Or use a static server (Live Server, serve, python -m http.server) to preview.

## Project Structure (relevant)
- html_css_js/layout-responsiveness/style.css — core stylesheet
- html_css_js/layout-responsiveness/index.html — page markup (expected)
- assets/ — images and icons (optional)

## Development
- Keep CSS modular and use variables defined in :root for theming.
- Test layout at breakpoints: 1024px, 768px, 420px.
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible link/button roles.
