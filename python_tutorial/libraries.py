# Libraries are collections of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks, making it easier to develop applications.
# In Python, libraries can be imported using the `import` statement.
# Think of Library as a toolbox that contains useful tools (functions and methods) for specific tasks.

# How to use a Library; importing built-in library, datetime, importing part of a library, random,and creating your own library.
# importing built-in Library: python has several built-in libraries that you can use without installing anything extra. One of the most 
# commonly used built-in libraries is the `datetime` library, which allows you to work with dates and times.

# Example math
import math
print("The value of pi is:", math.pi)
print("The square root of 16 is:", math.sqrt(16))

# Importing part of a library example
from math import sqrt, pi, pow, sin, cos
print("The value of pi is:", pi)
print("The square root of 16 is:", sqrt(16))
print("2 raised to the power of 3 is:", pow(2, 3))
print("The sine of 90 degrees is:", sin(math.radians(90)))

# random
import random
print("A random number between 1 and 10:", random.randint(1, 10))

# Datetime 
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print("Current date and time:", now)

# Python packages: these are third-party libraries that you can install using a package manager like pip and pypi. Others are flask, django, numpy, and pandas etc.
# Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage additional libraries that are not part of the Python standard library. Pip comes with
# python 3.4 or newer as its default package manager. to install a package, you can use the following command:
# pip install package_name

# PyPI (Python Package Index) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. It is the default package index used by pip. pip pulls packages from 
# PyPI and installs them on your system. you can view and search for packages on the PyPI website: https://pypi.org/

# Popular Extra Python Libraries:
# TensorFlow ‚Äì For machine learning and deep learning.
# Matplotlib ‚Äì For creating charts and graphs.
# SciPy ‚Äì For scientific and technical computing.
# Scrapy ‚Äì For web scraping (getting data from websites).
# Scikit-learn ‚Äì For machine learning (like predictions and classifications).
# PyGame ‚Äì For building games with graphics and sound.
# PyTorch ‚Äì For deep learning and neural networks.
# PyBrain ‚Äì For beginners in machine learning and AI.

# NumPy ‚Äì For numerical computing and working with arrays. Numerical operations are optimized for performance. pip install numpy is the command to install it.
# Numpy example
import numpy as np
# create simple array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Array:", arr)

# perform operations
print("Array multiplied by 2:", arr * 2)
print("Array plus 5:", arr + 5)
print("Mean of the array:", np.mean(arr))
print("Sum of the array:", np.sum(arr))

arr_task = np.array([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50])
# find the max and min of the array
print("Max of Task Array:", np.max(arr_task))
print("Min of Task Array:", np.min(arr_task))
# multiply all elements by 3
print("Task Array multiplied by 3:", arr_task * 3)

# Pandas ‚Äì For handling and analyzing data. Work with tables (just like Excel or Google Sheets!) Clean and filter data easily. Read from CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.
# Example
import pandas as pd
# Create data frame like table-like feature
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Data Frame:")
print(df)

# access column and filter rows
print("Names:")
print(df['Name'])
print("Ages:")
print(df['Age'])
print("Cities:")
print(df['City'])   

#  Reading CSV Files with Pandas
""":df = pd.read_csv('students.csv')
print(df.head())"""  # Show first 5 rows 

# create a dataframe with 4 students: name, age, grade, and year
# add a column called passed with grade >50 = True
# Filter and display only students who passed
data_students = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Jim', 'Jill'],
    'Age': [20, 21, 19, 22],
    'Grade': [55, 45, 75, 85],

}
df_students = pd.DataFrame(data_students)
df_students['Passed'] = df_students['Grade'] > 50
print("Students who passed:")
print(df_students[df_students['Passed']])
